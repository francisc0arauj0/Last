### About Last OS
Last OS is a 64-bit hobby operating system developed by a single programmer, with the ambitious goal of making it compatible with all architectures.

The project aims to explore the fundamentals of operating systems, always focusing on learning, performance, and portability.

Built entirely from scratch, Last OS demonstrates what can be achieved with curiosity, persistence, and a healthy dose of technical stubbornness.
